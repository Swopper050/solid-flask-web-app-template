## Installation
The template can be cloned into a new repository with the 'Use this template' button at the right top of this repository, or by using `git clone https://github.com/Swopper050/solid-flask-web-app-template.git`.

In order to run the project locally you need to:
  * [Install Node v20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
  * [Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  * [Install Python 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
